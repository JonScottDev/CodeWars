// DESCRIPTION:
// Our football team has finished the championship.

// Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

// For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

// Points are awarded for each match as follows:

// if x > y: 3 points (win)
// if x < y: 0 points (loss)
// if x = y: 1 point (tie)
// We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.

// Notes:

// our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
// 0 <= x <= 4
// 0 <= y <= 4

function points(games) {
    return games
      .map(game => {
          const [x,y] = game.split(':').map(s => parseInt(s))
          if(x > y) return 3
          if(x < y) return 0
          return 1
      })
      .reduce((total, cV) => total + cV)
  }
